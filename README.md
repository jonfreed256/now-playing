# NowPlaying
---

This app was built as a Redux learning exercise. It gives users the ability to find films that are currently playing at cinemas within a specified radius of a given zipcode - like Fandango. 
It was implemented with redux (createStore, applyMiddleware, combineReducers), redux-thunk (thunk), react-redux (Provider), and react-router-dom (BrowserRouter). There is a movieReducer and accompanying movieAction.
* it is yet to be responsive
