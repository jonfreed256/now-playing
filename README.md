# ** NowPlaying **

- Purpose \*

---

- This app was built as an exercise in learning Redux. It allows users to find films that are currently playing at cinemas within a specified radius of a given zipcode - much like Fandango.

* Architecture \*

---

- Implemented with redux (createStore, applyMiddleware, combineReducers), redux-thunk (thunk), react-redux (Provider), and react-router-dom (BrowserRouter).

- There is a movieReducer and accompanying movieAction.
